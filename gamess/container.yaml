description: GAMESS (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure
System) is a general ab initio quantum chemistry package that uses various
models to compute the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, or molecular
fragments. "Ab initio" refers to calculations that are performed from first
principles, meaning they do not rely on empirical or experimentally obtained
data.
