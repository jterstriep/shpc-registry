    TensorQTL is a computational framework designed to efficiently map 
    quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by leveraging the power of tensor 
    computation. Developed to handle large-scale genotype and gene 
    expression data, it aims to identify associations between genetic 
    variations and quantitative traits, such as gene expression levels 
    (eQTL analysis). By utilizing the parallel processing capabilities of 
    GPUs, TensorQTL significantly accelerates the computation of QTL 
    mapping compared to traditional methods. This tool is particularly 
    valuable in genomics and bioinformatics for its ability to process vast 
    datasets, facilitating a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of 
    complex traits and diseases. Its implementation allows for both cis- 
    and trans-QTL mapping, providing a comprehensive overview of genetic 
    influences on trait variation.
